Using Sockets and Pygame

Connect to the server using the provided ip and port in the console

If client window freezes it is okay, it will resume once 2 clients connect
Once a client has disconnected, server must be restarted

A simple game of tag, where the red square is 'it' and must tag the blue sqaure in under 10 seconds, or else the opponent takes victory

Have Fun!
